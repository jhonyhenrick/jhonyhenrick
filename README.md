Control and Automation Engineering | Product Testing Engineering Intern | Computer Vision
Hello! I am Jo√£o Henrique Gon√ßalves, a Control and Automation Engineering student and intern in Product Testing Engineering. My passion is applying advanced technologies, such as computer vision, to solve practical problems in the agrotechnology sector.

Currently, I am working on my Final Year Project (TCC), which uses computer vision for seed disc analysis in planting seed meters. The goal is to classify the seeds in the disc holes, identifying misses, doubles, or normal seeds, aiming to improve planting efficiency.

üöÄ Areas of Interest:
Computer Vision applied to agrotechnology
Product and Sensor Testing and Validation
Control System Development

üìö Recent Projects:
Seed Disc Analysis with Computer Vision: Using image processing techniques to classify seed quality in agricultural seed meters.
ISOBUS Monitoring: Experience with ISOBUS monitors for communication and control of agricultural implements.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills:
Programming in Python, C/C++
Development with OpenCV
Tools for Hardware and Software Testing and Validation
Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
Experience with embedded systems and microcontrollers
